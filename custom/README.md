The Custom Folder
=================

Things should only go in this folder if they are one-off usages to speed development.

The drupal and vendor paths are automatically merged over the respective folders in the project root.

Once a module is stable and ready to be put into a sandbox or standalone repository,
then it should be removed from this path, and included in the profile.make file.
